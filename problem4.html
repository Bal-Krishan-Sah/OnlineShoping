            A stratovolcano is a tall, conical volcano composed of one layer of hardened lava, tephra, and volcanic ash.
            These volcanoes are characterized by a steep profile and periodic, explosive eruptions.
            The lava that flows from them is highly viscous, and cools and hardens before spreading very far.
            The source magma of this rock is classified as acidic, or high in silica to intermediate (rhyolite, dacite, or andesite. or basalt).
            This is in contrast to less viscous basic magma that forms shield volcanoes (such as Mauna Loa in Hawaii), 
            which have a wide base and more gently sloping profile.Many stratovolcanoes exceed a height of 2500 m.

                Stratovolcanoes are common at subduction zones, forming chains and clusters along plate tectonic boundaries where oceanic crust is drawn under continental crust (continental arc volcanism, e.g. Cascade Range, Andes, Campania) or another oceanic plate (island arc volcanism, e.g. Japan, Philippines, Aleutian Islands). The magma forming stratovolcanoes rises when water trapped both in hydrated minerals and in the porous basalt rock of the upper oceanic crust is released into mantle rock of the asthenosphere above the sinking oceanic slab.[7] The release of water from hydrated minerals is termed "dewatering", and occurs at specific pressures and temperatures for each mineral, as the plate descends to greater depths.[8] The water freed from the rock lowers the melting point of the overlying mantle rock, which then undergoes partial melting and rises due to its lighter density relative to the surrounding mantle rock, and pools temporarily at the base of the lithosphere. The magma then rises through the crust, incorporating silica-rich crustal rock, leading to a final intermediate composition. When the magma nears the top surface, it pools in a magma chamber within the crust below the stratovolcano.[7]
                The processes that trigger the final eruption remain a matter of research. Possible mechanisms include:[9][10]
